CAREER PROFILE
Research Associate with 2.5 years of experience in charge of studying the relationship between the innate immune system and retinal degeneration at the top eye institute in the nation, Bascom Palmer.  Trained graduate students, interns, and full-time leaders of other Hackam Lab projects. Produced significant data and currently writing scientific paper.                     

LAB EXPERIENCE
Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, FL 	March 2016 – Present
Research Associate, MyD88 Project Leader, Hackam Lab
•	Produced and analyzed statistically significant data on the impact of inhibiting the innate immune system on retinal degeneration in a rodent model, searching for therapies to translate to human treatment.
•	Evaluated data from a diverse array of procedures to elucidate behavioral, phenotype, and molecular changes in rodents due to treatment, including flow cytometry, RNA seq, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, fluorescent imaging, TUNEL staining, Electroretinograms, Optical Coherence Tomography, and Optokinetics testing.
•	Mentored and directed a team of Ophthalmology masters students, graduate students, undergraduate students, full-time interns, new hires, and volunteers, and coordinated efforts to gather data on the project over the span of 2.5 years.
•	Performed all animal handling, surgeries, breeding, genotyping, and administering of treatment for the project.
•	Wrote scientific paper on findings (in progress).

University of Michigan; Ann Arbor, MI	May 2014-August 2014
RNA Research Intern, Dr. Julia Widom
•	Used smFRET laser technology to investigate the movements of nucleic acids under the activity of RNA spliceosomal helicase Prp22. Responsible for conducting smFRET experiments on behalf of Dr. Widom.
•	Translated chromophore activity to individual graphs correlating activity of chromophores transferring energy to one another using MATLAB. Created statistical graphs of molecular behavior under manipulated conditions. 
•	Wrote, designed, presented project poster at research symposiums at University of Notre Dame, University of Michigan, and University of Miami.

University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; Miami, FL
Undergrad Research Assistant, Dr. Arun Malhotra	  September 2012 -August 2013
•	Performed small-scale plasmid preps; calibrated and used spectrometer to assess growth of liquid cell cultures; gel electrophoresis of DNA; double digests; used valve-type processor to lyse cells; DNA plasmid cloning and desired-protein amplification using E .coli cells. Purified a desired protein using polyhistidine tag and a chelator. Identified successful isolation of protein using SDS-PAGE. 
Undergrad Research Assistant, Dr. Sandra Lemmon 							   
•	Performed basic lab procedures; mixed solutions, performed QIA miniprep, inoculated yeast strains onto media.
•	Shadowed researchers and developed an understanding of the projects, goals, and methods designed to reach them. Read articles suggested by lab technician to become knowledgeable about the project.
